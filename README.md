# UNE
Please do not use UNE for any actual work cause it will not be a good time :)

# Programing in UNE:

The only characters in UNE are: "0123456789.,v=p{}+" everything else will be regarded as a comment. Please do note that if you write a comment containing either "v" or "p" it wel execute said action.

UNE is a esoteric programing language desingen in c++.
There are planks in UNE, a plank is sort of a array wich can hold 10 different numbers. When creating a new plank the previous one gets deleted for ever!

Createing a plank:
```
=
```

A nail is a data entrance wich can only hold ints a nail also needs to be hammered in using "V"
To add a value of 1 to a nail we use "." and to subtract we use ","
after a nail has been hammered in the value is set for ever and can not be changed. you can use "p" to print out the ascii value of the nail.
Remember, if you add a new nail you cannot access the old one so print it while you can.

You can use loops to make repetitive code easier. A loop works like this:
You use the "¤" character to tell UNE that you wan't to start a loop then the character after the loop symbol needs to be a value from 0-9 this value will be timed by 10 and repeated for however long. and then use "{" and "}" with your code inbetween them to be looped.

Here is a loop example:
```
=
+
¤5{..}..
v
p

```
```
= -> instanciate a plank
+ -> add a nail
¤5{..}.. -> this becomes 102 in ascii
v -> punch in the nail
p -> print the value of the current nail
```
